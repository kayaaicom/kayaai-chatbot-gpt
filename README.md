What is an artificial intelligence chatbot?

An artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot is a programmed software that utilizes language processing abilities to comprehend human language and respond aptly. This technology represents a new revolution in communication and is being swiftly adopted by numerous businesses due to its potential to deliver superior service quality.

Chatbots are born from the amalgamation of AI, machine learning, and natural language processing (NLP) technologies. Typically, they are integrated into chat-based interfaces that answer user queries or perform specific tasks. However, the capabilities of chatbots are not limited to these simple functions. Modern chatbots developed with AI and advanced technologies can comprehend the complex aspects of language and facilitate richer interactions.

The abilities of AI chatbots hinge on a set of intercommunicating technologies. Natural Language Processing (NLP) enables chatbots to understand the meaning and context of human language. Machine learning allows chatbots to learn from past interactions and provide more accurate responses over time. These two technologies ensure chatbots not only deliver programmed responses but also produce suitable responses to new and unexpected questions.
